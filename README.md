# PRODUCTION READme

Live @ https://facebook-clone-appacademy.herokuapp.com/

Welcome to my app's READme, here is my past 2 weeks' effort to turn a blinking terminal screen into a functional clone of Facebook!

A few things to try as you navigate my app: 

1. As a brand new user to this application, you should be able to signup on the greeting page or hit 'Demo Account' to
get a *one-click* login to the site where you'll be met with a users index page where you can **accept/reject friend requests** on the left, see your **friends** listed on thr right, and a **list of my app's users** in the middle.

2. Try navigating to your profile page in the navbar (top right, 'demo' button), or check out another user's profile page.

3. You will be able to create a post directly from your profile page or the *+* button also within the navbar; all posts will show up on **YOUR** profile page where you can also leave comments on the post itself.

4. Try **accepting/declining** user friend **requests** on the main page; log in to a second user (use => email: 'duser2', password: 'demo1234' or choose the **DARK SIDE** and use => email: 'dvader', password: 'demo1234') and create a request with the demo through the *Add Friend* button on the demo's profile page. Log back into the demo and check out the request!

Notable screen snippets:









A few features I'd like to implement in the future:

- Showing an **avatar** for the logged in user and other users as you navigate around the page (a post/comment with an avatar, etc)
- Implementing a **feed** which would hold posts and comment from the logged in user and all friends of that user
